# 📄 Project Report: Multimodal Chatbot

**Project Name:** Multimodal Chatbot  
**Developer:** Adham Ansari  
**Repository:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/KeSi-AN/multimodal-chatbot)

---

## ✅ Overview

The **Multimodal Chatbot** is an AI assistant capable of processing and responding to both **textual and visual inputs**. It integrates language and image understanding using foundation models to provide richer, context-aware conversations.

This chatbot demonstrates how conversational agents can go beyond text to interpret **images**, answer visual questions, and relate them to text-based prompts.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Create an interactive chatbot that accepts both images and text.
- Generate responses that reference both visual and textual context.
- Utilize advanced vision-language models (e.g., BLIP, GPT-4V, or similar).
- Deploy via a lightweight web UI for real-time usage.

## ✅ Tools & Technologies Used

| Category          | Stack                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Language          | Python                                    |
| Frameworks        | Streamlit / Gradio                        |
| Models            | BLIP / CLIP / GPT-4-Vision                |
| Libraries         | `transformers`, `torch`, `PIL`, `openai`, `gradio` |

## ✅ Key Features

- **Image Captioning**: Understands uploaded images and generates descriptive captions.
- **Visual Question Answering**: Users can ask questions about an image (e.g., “What is the person doing?”).
- **Context Fusion**: Combines visual content and follow-up text for deeper Q&A.
- **Simple UI**: Upload image + type query = receive intelligent, multimodal answers.

---

## ✅ Workflow / Pipeline

```plaintext
[Image Upload + Text Input] → Vision Encoder (e.g., CLIP/BLIP) → LLM Response Generation → Display Output
```

- Vision encoder extracts features from image
- Language model receives combined image and text embeddings
- Response is grounded in both modalities

## ✅ Challenges

- Balancing latency and model size (especially for vision transformers)
- Ensuring GPU availability for inference
- Managing context overflow when dealing with large images and long text

---

## ✅ Limitations

- Limited to pre-defined vision models (not trained from scratch)
- No memory — each session is stateless
- Doesn’t support multi-turn conversation with visual context yet

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The **Multimodal Chatbot** is a cutting-edge conversational interface that merges image and text understanding. It lays the foundation for next-generation assistants that can "see" and "read" simultaneously, with applications in education, accessibility, and productivity.

---

## ✅ Future Work

- Add audio modality (speech input/output)
- Implement dialogue memory with visual references
- Integrate real-world datasets for fine-tuning vision tasks
